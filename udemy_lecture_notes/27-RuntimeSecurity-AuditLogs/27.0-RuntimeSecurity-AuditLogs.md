3) Use Audit Logs - To Investigate Access History

## 1 Intro

Audit Logs - History of API Requests

- Did some access an important secret while it wasn't protected
- When was the last time user X did not access cluster Y?
- Does my CRD work properly?

## 2 API Request Stages
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/
1) RequestReceived - The stage for events generated as soon as the audit handler receives the request, and before it is delegated down the handler chain.
2) ResponseStarted - Once the response headers are sent, but before the response body is sent. This stage is only generated for long-running requests (e.g. watch).
3) ResponseComplete - The response body has been completed and no more bytes will be sent.
4) Panic - Events generated when a panic occurred.

## 3 Audit Logging Levels

1) None - don't log events that match this rule.
2) Metadata - log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but not request or response body.
3) Request - log event metadata and request body but not response body. This does not apply for non-resource requests.
4) RequestResponse - log event metadata, request and response bodies. This does not apply for non-resource requests.

## 4 Sample Audit Policy

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1 # This is required.
kind: Policy
# Don't generate audit events for all requests in RequestReceived stage.
omitStages:
  - "RequestReceived"
rules:
  # Log pod changes at RequestResponse level
  - level: RequestResponse
    resources:
    - group: ""
      # Resource "pods" doesn't match requests to any subresource of pods,
      # which is consistent with the RBAC policy.
      resources: ["pods"]
  # Log "pods/log", "pods/status" at Metadata level
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["pods/log", "pods/status"]

  # Don't log requests to a configmap called "controller-leader"
  - level: None
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["configmaps"]
      resourceNames: ["controller-leader"]

  # Don't log watch requests by the "system:kube-proxy" on endpoints or services
  - level: None
    users: ["system:kube-proxy"]
    verbs: ["watch"]
    resources:
    - group: "" # core API group
      resources: ["endpoints", "services"]

  # Don't log authenticated requests to certain non-resource URL paths.
  - level: None
    userGroups: ["system:authenticated"]
    nonResourceURLs:
    - "/api*" # Wildcard matching.
    - "/version"

  # Log the request body of configmap changes in kube-system.
  - level: Request
    resources:
    - group: "" # core API group
      resources: ["configmaps"]
    # This rule only applies to resources in the "kube-system" namespace.
    # The empty string "" can be used to select non-namespaced resources.
    namespaces: ["kube-system"]

  # Log configmap and secret changes in all other namespaces at the Metadata level.
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: "" # core API group
      resources: ["secrets", "configmaps"]

  # Log all other resources in core and extensions at the Request level.
  - level: Request
    resources:
    - group: "" # core API group
    - group: "extensions" # Version of group should NOT be included.

  # A catch-all rule to log all other requests at the Metadata level.
  - level: Metadata
    # Long-running requests like watches that fall under this rule will not
    # generate an audit event in RequestReceived.
    omitStages:
      - "RequestReceived"

```

## Questions
1) What stages are available when a request registers with API-Server [4]?
- RequestReceived, ResponseStarted, ResponseComplete, Panic

2) What levels are available for Audit Logging Levels [4]?
- None, Metadata, Request, RequestResponse

3) Where can Audit Logs be stored [3]?
- Log (JSON Files), Webhook (External API, ie. ElasticSearch, Fluentd), Dynamic backend (AuditSink API)

4) For an Auditing Policy Object, how do you...
- Skip a stage?
  - policy.omitStages[]
- Specify a resource for a certain Level?
  - policy.rules.level.resources

5) Can you specify multiple rules for the same level? (ie. multiple rules for "None")?
- Yes

6) Can you skip/include a resource by name? If so, how?
- policy.rules.level.resources.resourceNames

5) What flag do you need to add for the Kube-APIServer?
- --audit-policy-file=FILE
- --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit/policy.yaml

6) NOTE -
