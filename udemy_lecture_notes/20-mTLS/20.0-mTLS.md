# Introduction/Overview

1) mTLS/Pod2Pod Communication
2) Service Meshes
3) Scenarios

## 1 mTLS - mutual TLS
- 2-Way (BiLateral) Authentication

### Ingress | Breakdown
- Public-facing Ingress - Has HTTPS connection, TLS protected
- TLS Termination - Means traffic is decrypted on the Ingress
  - Then passed to the cluster
  
### Pod2Pod Communication
- Pod1 -> Pod2 Communication 
  - Pod1 - Has client-cert
  - Pod2 - Has server-cert
- Pod2 -> Pod1 Communication 
  - Pod1 - Has server-cert
  - Pod2 - Has client-cert

## 2 ServiceMesh/Proxy SideCar Container
- SideCar container - Contains everything regarding mTLS
  - Encrypts/Decrypts Traffic
  - Contains Certs/CAs etc.
  - Managed by External Manager

### SideCar-MainContainer | Communication Breakdown
Requirements: 
- iptables rules - Route traffic via proxy
  - Create `initContainer`
  - Needs `NET_ADMIN` Capability

## Questions
1) When creating a sidecar container for mTLS, what...
- Should be installed on the sidecar container?
- Capabilities should be added to the Pod?

1a) 
- a) iptables. 
- b) NET_ADMIN
