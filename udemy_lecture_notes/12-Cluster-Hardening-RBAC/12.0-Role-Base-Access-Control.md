## 1 RBAC
1) Deny-by-Default - Have to **whitelist** resources you want allowed
2) Roles - Namespaced
3) ClusterRole - Non-Namespaced


## 2 Accounts
1) "Normal User" 
- No "k8s User" resource
- Only requirement - Must have a cert + key

### How to sign a k8s cert?
1) Create CSR (Certificate Signing Request) - Via OpenSSL 
2) Submit to k8s CA: 
- Updates the CSR - (Within CSR)

## QUESTIONS
1) What's one thing to be aware of with ClusterRole Bindings?
- Users have access to namespaces created IN THE FUTURE!!

2) If you have a clusterrole, can you tie it to a user/namespace via a clusterrolebinding?
- NO. Use Rolebinding (RB's can be tied to clusterroles)

3) In Rolebindings, what subject types are namespaced? 
- ServiceAccounts (format: <namespace: sa-name>)

4) What's the requirement to be a k8s "User"? Are there any k8s "User" objects? 
- Cert+Key. No

5) What are the requirements for a User's Cert? 
- 

6) Can you invalidate a certificate? 
- NO!!. 

7) What can you do if a cert has been leaked [3]?
- Remove all access via RBAC 
- Username can't be used - Until cert has expired
- Create new CA - & Reissue all certs

8) Commands for creating an OpenSSL Key/CSR?
> a) openssl genrsa -out jane.key 2048
> b) openssl req -new -key jane.key -out jane.csr 

9) When creating a k8s CSR, what do you paste into the "request" field? How do you format it?
> a) Paste the CSR (b64 encoded). "cat my.csr | base64 -w 0"

10) Format for "k auth can-i --as" when using service accounts?
> --as=system:serviceaccount:[NAMESPACE]:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]

11) How can you give a namespaced serviceaccount cluster-wide permissions?
> a) Create clusterrolebinding that ties namespaced sa with a clusterrole.
