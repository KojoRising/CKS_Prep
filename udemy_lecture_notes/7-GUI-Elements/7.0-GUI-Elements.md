# Introduction/Overview

1) GUI Elements and the Dashboard
2) Methods of access (from outside)
3) Restricting Access

## GUI Elements + Dashboard
1) Only expose Service - If Needed
2) Cluster internal svc/dashboards - Use `kubectl port-forward` vs using NodePort/LB Services


### Kubectl Proxy
1) Creates Proxy Server - Between Localhost/K8s API Server
2) Uses connection - Configured in KubeConfig
3) Allows API Access - Locally over HTTP

### Kubectl Port-Forward
1) Forwards connections - From localhost-port to pod-port
2) More generic - then Kubectl Proxy
3) Can be used - For all TCP Traffic (Not just HTTP)
- CLARIFICATION: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23157817/http-vs-tcp-ip-send-data-to-a-web-server
- IP -> TCP -> HTTP/HTTPS

# QUESTIONS
1) How does kubectl communicate with the API-Server? How about `kubectl proxy`?
- kubectl - HTTPS. kubectl proxy  - HTTP.

2) Compare/Contract "k port-forward" && "k proxy"? 
- "port-forward" is more generic than "k proxy"

3)
