# Introduction/Overview

1) Technical Overview
2) Breaking out of Containers
3) gVisor/Kata Containers


## 1 Intro

#### Recall 
1) Docker Container Processes - Run on the Linux Kernel
- Difference - They are **wrapped** in a ***kernel group***

2) Multiple Docker Containers  - Running on a single host
- Separated by - **Kernel Groups**

## 2 Sandboxes

#### What are sandboxes?
- Playground
- Simulated Testing Environment
- Development Server
- ***Security Layer - To Reduce Attack Surface***

#### Where are Sandboxes located?
- Between Kernel && User-Spaces

## 3 OCI (Open Container Initiative)
- Linux Foundation Project - To design open standards for virtualization 
  
OCI - Creates `OCI/Runtime Spec`
`runc` - Is an *implemenation* of the `OCI/Runtime Spec`
`containerd`/`docker` - Use `runc` under the hood

#### K8s - Back in the day...
`Kubelet` - Connected directly w/ `dockershim`, which then connected to `dockerd`, `containerd`, `runc`

Then later on... CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

## 4 Kata Containers
- Instead of - { Kernel -> Kernel-Group -> App-Process }
- We have - { Kernel -> Virtual-Machine -> Virtual-Kernel -> App-Process }

#### Kata Container Overview
- Strong Separation layer
- Runs every container - In its own private VM (Hypervisor based)
- QEMU as default - (Needs virtualization, like nested virtualization in cloud)

## 5 gVisor - UserSpace Kernel for Containers

#### gVisor Overview
- Another Layer of Separation
- NOT hypervisor/VM-based
- Simulates kernel syscalls with limited functionality
- Runs in `userspace` - Separated from Linux Kernel 
- Runtime is - `runsc`


## Questions 
1) When multiple docker containers are running on a single host, what Linux construct are they separated by?
- **Kernel Group**

2) Where are Sandboxes located?
- Between Kernel-Space && User-Space - Right above System Calls

3) Do Sandboxes come for free? What scenarios are they good for? What scenarios are they not good for?
- No
- Good for - Smaller Containers
- Not good for - SysCall-Heavy Processes

4) Primary difference between gVisor & Kata Containers
- Kata Containers - Basically run containers in VMs (each with their own virtual Kernel)
- gVisor - Created isolated kernel in User-Space, which then communicates to the Kernel in Kernel-Space (w/ Limited System Calls)

5) What k8s object is required for creating an independent runtime? How can a pod be programmed to use this different runtime? 
- RuntimeClass. pod.spec.runtimeClassName 

6) COMMAND. How can you check the current kernel that's running? What's a simple test to verify if a pod is running on gVisor?
- `uname -r`. Run `uname -r` in both the pod and node.
