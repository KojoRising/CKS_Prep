# Introduction/Overview

1) Syscall and Processes
2) strace and /proc
3) Tools & Scenarios

## 1 Behavioral Analytics | Host & Container Level

### Recall | Kernel vs User Space
1) User-Space = Applications/Libraries
2) Kernel-Space - Hardware -> Kernel -> Syscall Interface

Syscalls - Can be made directly by apps, but more commonly by libraries

#### Seccomp/AppArmor

## 2 */proc* directory
- Information & connections to processes and kernel
- Study it to learn how processes work
- Configuration & Administrative tasks
- Contains files that don't exist, yet you can access these

## 3 Falco

#### Falco | Overview
- Cloud-Native runtime security (CNCF)
- ACCESS - Deep kernel tracing built on the Linux Kernel
- ASSERT:
  - Describe security rules against a system (+default ones)
  - Detect Unwanted behavior 
- ACTION:
  - Automated response to security violations

## Questions
1) How can you view syscalls made by the system?
- `strace -cw ls [DIR]. DIR == / (usually)`

2) How can you view syscalls made by a certain process [2]?
- `ps aux | grep [PNAME] => strace -cwf -p [PID]`

3) If you try to `ps aux | grep IMG` for a pod, and the image isn't there, what's the solution (probably)?
- Run ps aux on the correct node (worker)

4) What are some important files in the `/proc/PID` directory?
- environ - Has all environment variables (say for a pod)
- fd - File Descriptor

5) For troubleshooting Falco, what should you ensure regarding pods?
- Ensure Falco is running/installed on the same node as the running pod. 

6) Where are Falco rules stored? What can you use to override current Falco Rules?
- `/etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml`
- `/etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml`

7) How can you get the strace for a certain command? How can you pipe `strace` output?
  strace [COMAND] 2&>1. ie. `strace kill -9 1234`
   
8) Where does falco typically log its output? Command to verify a falco rule that logged?
- /var/log/syslog
- cat /var/log/syslog | grep falco | grep "RULE-OUTPUT"
