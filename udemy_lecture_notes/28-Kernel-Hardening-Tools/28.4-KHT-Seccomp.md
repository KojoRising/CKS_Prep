## Questions
1) For a seccomp profile, where are syscalls located (jsonpath)? 
- syscalls.names

2) How do you load a seccomp profile into a pod?
  - pod.spec.securityContext.seccompProfile
    - type: Localhost
    - localhostProfile: profile-name.json

3) Where does localhostProfile load profiles from (dirpath)?
  - /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/

4) COMMON MISTAKE. If you see the following error "cannot load seccomp profile...no such file or directory", what is probably the issue?
- Copy the profile.json onto all/worker nodes.
