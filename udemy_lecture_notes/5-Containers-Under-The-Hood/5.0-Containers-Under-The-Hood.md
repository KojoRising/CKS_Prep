# Introduction

## Overview
1) Architecture
2) Components
3) Secure Component Communication

## 1) Kernel vs User Space
1) User Space - Libraries + Applications
2) Kernel Space - Hardware, Linux Kernel, & Syscall Interface

### Kernel Space Breakdown
1) Hardware
2) Linux Kernel 
3) Syscall Interface - Provides system-calls (ie. *getpid(), reboot()*) to libraries (ie. glibc, libxyz) or applications (ie. firefox, curl)

### User Space Breakdown
1) Libraries
2) Applications

## VMs vs Containers
1) VM - Physical {OS+Kernel} -> Virtual {OS+Kernel} -> App Process
   - Kernel - CANNOT access App-Process
2) Container - Physical {OS+Kernel} -> Kernel-Group -> App Process
  - Kernel - CAN access App-Process

## Linux Kernel Namespaces 
1) PID
  - Isolates processes from each other
  - One process cannot see others
  - Process ID 10 can exist multiples times (in separate namespaces)
2) Mount - Restricts access to mounts/root file-system
3) Network 
  - Only access certain network devices
  - Firewall, routing rules, socket port numbers
  - Not able to see all traffic/contact all endpoints
4) User
  - Different set of user ids used
  - User(0) inside one namespace can be different from user(0) inside another namespace
  - DON'T use host-root user (0) intra-container

## Linux Kernel Isolation/Container Isolation
What do the following restrict?
1) Namespaces - Other Processes, Users, Filesystem
2) cgroups - Resource usage of processes (RAM, CPU, Disk)
3) 
4) 


## QUESTIONS

Q: *What spaces are present in Linux Architecture [2]?*
- User-Space & Kernel Space

Q: *What is present in a Linux User-Space [2]?*
- Applications + Libraries

Q: *What is present in a Linux Kernel-Space [3]?*
- Hardware, Kernel, + Syscall Interface

Q: *In what 2 ways can an Application execute syscalls?*
- Directly, or via Library

Q: *Can a containerized app perform syscalls against the Host OS?*
- Yes!!

Q: *What's the structure for a VM [5]?*
- Physical {OS+Kernel}->Virtual {OS+Kernel}->App-Process

Q: *What's the structure for a Container [4]?*
- Physical {OS+Kernel}->Kernel-Group->App-Process

Q: *What can a Container's Kernel do that a VM's Kernel can't?*
- Container's Kernel - Can access App-Process

Q: *What are some ways we can provide Linux Kernel/Container Isolation? [2] What do each restrict [3+3]?*
- Namespaces - Other Processes, Users, Filesystem
- cgroups - RAM/CPU/Disk (Resource) Utilization
