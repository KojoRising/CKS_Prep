## Backend to Database Traffic

Q: `Allow backend pods to talk to database pods. Database pods are in the "cassandra" namespace.`

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backToDB
  namespace: default
spec:
  policyTypes: [Egress]
  podSelector:
    matchLabels: {id: backend}
  egress:
    - to:
      - namespaceSelector: 
          matchLabels: {id: cassandra}
```
