## 1 Security Contexts


## 2 Privileged Containers
2) What does running `privileged` mean, in regards to running as root intra-container and outside of a container?
- Root(0) intra-container is not the same "root" user as the host. But when you run privileged, there's a direct mapping
between host-root(0) and container-root(0)
  
3) How can you test if a pod is running privileged (command)?
- `sysctl kernel.hostname=myfakehost`

4) Command. How can you check what user/group a process is running as?
- `id`

## 3 Privilege Escalation
5) What's the difference between privilegeEscalation and running privileged?
- Privilege Escalation means gaining privileges `higher` than the parent

6) What is the privilege escalation flag, and is it set on pod or container level?
- allowPrivilegeEscalation. `False`

7) How can you check if a pod is running with privilegeEscalation?
   `cat /proc/1/status | grep "NoNewPrivs"`. 1 means privilegeEscalation, 0 means not.

## 4 Pod Security Policies
- Cluster-Level resource
- Determines that a Pod - Must run under X security policies
- `Is an Admission Controller`

## Questions
1) How can you program a pod with supplementary group ids?
- `pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup`

2) What does running `privileged` mean, in regards to running as root intra-container and outside of a container?
- Root(0) intra-container is not the same "root" user as the host. But when you run privileged, there's a direct mapping
between host-root(0) and container-root(0)
  
3) How can you test if a pod is running privileged (command)?

5) What's the difference between privilegeEscalation and running privileged?
- Privilege Escalation means gaining privileges `higher` than the parent

6) What is the privilege escalation flag, and is it set on pod or container level?
- allowPrivilegeEscalation. `False` 

7) How can you check if a pod is running with privilegeEscalation?
`cat /proc/1/status | grep "NoNewPrivs"`. 1 means privilegeEscalation, 0 means not.

8) When creating pods under PSPs', why doesn't controller-based Pod-Creation fail? How can this be solved [2]?
- Deploys etc. don't run under admin rights. So it doesn't get created.
- Create Role + Role bindings

9) Role + Rolebinding PSP Commands?
- kc role psp-access --verb=use --resource=podsecuritypolicies
- kc rolebinding psp-access --role=psp-access --serviceaccount=default:default
