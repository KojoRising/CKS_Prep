1) Host OS Footprint
2) IAM Roles
3) Network Access

## 2 Nodes that run in k8s
- Only purpose - Run k8s components
  - Remove unnecessary services
  
- Node recycling
  - Nodes should be ephemeral
  - Created from Images
  - Can be recycled at any time (and quickly)

## 3 Linux Distributions
- Often include number of services
- Meant to help, but widen attack surface
- The more existing + running services, the more convenient
