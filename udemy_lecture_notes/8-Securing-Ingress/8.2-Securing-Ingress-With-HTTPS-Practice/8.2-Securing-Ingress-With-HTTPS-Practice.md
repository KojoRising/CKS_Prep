# Introduction/Overview

1) What is Ingress
2) Setup an Ingress with Services
3) Secure Ingress with TLS

## Resources:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls

## Ingress Example 1
From KodeKloud CKA Example: https://kodekloud.com/topic/practice-test-cka-ingress-networking-1-2/

1) Get NodePort Svc's HTTPS Port: (32103 in this example)
```yaml
root@controlplane ~ ✖ kg svc
NAME                                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller             NodePort    10.110.158.142   <none>        80:30080/TCP,443:32103/TCP   28m
```

2) Try using the NodePort Svc's HTTPS Port. Fails (Unless you use the '-k' flag, shown below)
```yaml
root@controlplane ~ ➜  curl https://10.34.77.9:32103/service1
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.

root@controlplane ~ ✖ curl -k https://10.34.77.9:32103/service1 | head -n 5
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   615  100   615    0     0  55909      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 55909
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
```

3) Notice the Fake Cert Below
```yaml
root@controlplane ~ ➜  curl -kv https://10.34.77.9:32103/service1 | head -n 5
*   Trying 10.34.77.9...
* TCP_NODELAY set
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0* Connected to 10.34.77.9 (10.34.77.9) port 32103 (#0)
* ALPN, offering h2
* ALPN, offering http/1.1
* successfully set certificate verify locations:
*   CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
      CApath: /etc/ssl/certs
...
...

* ALPN, server accepted to use h2
* Server certificate:
*  subject: O=Acme Co; CN=Kubernetes Ingress Controller Fake Certificate
*  start date: Aug 27 16:02:44 2022 GMT
*  expire date: Aug 27 16:02:44 2023 GMT
*  issuer: O=Acme Co; CN=Kubernetes Ingress Controller Fake Certificate
*  SSL certificate verify result: unable to get local issuer certificate (20), continuing anyway.
```

4) Create Your Own Cert (Use below OpenSSL Command). NOTE - Use Common Name "secure-ingress.com"
```yaml
root@controlplane ~ ➜  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes 
Can't load /root/.rnd into RNG
140614121275840:error:2406F079:random number generator:RAND_load_file:Cannot open file:../crypto/rand/randfile.c:88:Filename=/root/.rnd
Generating a RSA private key
..............................++++
....++++
writing new private key to 'key.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:secure-ingress.com
Email Address []:
```

5) Create Secret using above key.pem/cert.pem
```yaml
k create secret tls secure-ingress --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
secret/secure-ingress created
```

6) Modify Ingress's Spec with below
```yaml
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - secure-ingress.com
      secretName: secure-ingress
  rules:
    - host: secure-ingress.com
```

7) Use the below curl command. We use `--resolve` flag from curl to resolve the hostname (else we'd have to create an entry in our `/etc/hosts` file)
```yaml
root@controlplane ~ ➜  curl -kv https://secure-ingress.com:32103 --resolve secure-ingress.com:32103:10.34.77.9
* Added secure-ingress.com:32103:10.34.77.9 to DNS cache
* Rebuilt URL to: https://secure-ingress.com:32103/
* Hostname secure-ingress.com was found in DNS cache
*   Trying 10.34.77.9...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to secure-ingress.com (10.34.77.9) port 32103 (#0)
* ALPN, offering h2
* ALPN, offering http/1.1
* successfully set certificate verify locations:
*   CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  CApath: /etc/ssl/certs
...
...
* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* ALPN, server accepted to use h2
* Server certificate:
*  subject: C=AU; ST=Some-State; O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd; CN=secure-ingress.com
*  start date: Aug 27 16:38:52 2022 GMT
*  expire date: Aug 27 16:38:52 2023 GMT
*  issuer: C=AU; ST=Some-State; O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd; CN=secure-ingress.com
