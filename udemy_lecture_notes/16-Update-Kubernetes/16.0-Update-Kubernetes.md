# Introduction/Overview

1) Release Cycles
2) Version Differences of Components
3) Upgrade!!

## 1 K8s Release Cycles
- Semvar Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Minor Version - Every 3 Months
- No LTS (Long Term Support)

## 2 Cluster Upgrade | Overview
1) Master Components 1st - API-Server, Controller-Manager, Scheduler, etc.
2) Worker Components - Kubelet, Kube-Proxy
3) Components - Should be within 1 version of API-Server (For in-place upgrades)
  - Example:
  - 1) Upgrade API-Server - 1.17-1.18 ==> *At this point, Scheduler/Controller-Manager are at 1.17*
  - 2) Then upgrade Scheduler/Controller-Manager - 1.17-1.18
