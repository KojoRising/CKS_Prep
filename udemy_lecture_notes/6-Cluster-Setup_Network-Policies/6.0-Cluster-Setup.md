# Introduction/Overview

1) Network Policies
2) Default Deny
3) Scenario



## Network Policies

### Overview
1) Firewall Rules in Kubernetes
2) Implemented by CNI Network Plugins (ie. Calico, Weave)
3) Namespace Level - ONLY Valid in single namespace
4) Restrict - Ingress/Egress for group of pods


### Recall
1) Network Policy Selectors:
- Specific Pods
- Specific Namespaces
- `ipBlock" - Specific IP Addresses

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      id: frontend
  policyTypes: [Egress]
  egress:
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              id: ns1
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              id: backend
```

# QUESTIONS

Q: `How are multiple "to" or "from" fields interpreted in a single Network Policy? What about multiple rules within a single "to" or "from" block?`
- "OR'd"

Q: `How are multiple "to" or "from" fields interpreted in a single Network Policy?`


Q: `Default "Deny" Network Policy?`
- Don't include "ingress/egress" fields
- PolicyTypes - Should include whether "Egress" or "Ingress" should be restricted.

Q: `How can you create a default-deny policy that still allows DNS traffic (ports + podSelector)? How does this work?`
- Allow "egress" traffic to pods with `k8s-app: kube-dns` label AND expose ports TCP-53/UDP-53. Is redirecting to `kube-dns` service + `coredns` pods

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress-to-kube-dns
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: foo
  egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector: {}
    - to:
        - namespaceSelector: {}
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              k8s-app: kube-dns
      ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
```

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes: [Ingress, Egress]
```

Q: `Create Network Policy that allows traffic from frontend pods to backend pods`
```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: frontTwoBack
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: 
    matchLabels:
      id: frontend
  policyTypes: [Egress]
  egress:
    - to:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels: 
            id: backend
```
